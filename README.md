[*Experimental Implementation and Verification of Spectral Seriation*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rWICHKj5lT8UcbzgWpoFquKf18-Blq36/view?usp=sharing)

## Usage

Download and run the code in **/src/convergence.py** to view the results that appear in the poster (linked above). The other files are helper or test functions for the main program or separate files related to the concept of spectral seriation.

For instance, running **/src/plot_3d.py** will display a plot of any inputted 3D graphon.

## Purpose

This code was written to test the following theorem:
> Suppose W is a regular Robinson graphon. If G<sub>n</sub> is a sequence of graphs converging to W in cut distance, and H<sub>n</sub> the permutation of G<sub>n</sub> which is ordered by its Fiedler vector, then H<sub>n</sub> converges to W<sup>φ</sup> (a permutation of W) in cut norm for some measure-preserving map φ.

All code in this repository has been written by **Aman Singh** (amansjot) for the 2023 Summer Scholars research program at the University of Delaware.
